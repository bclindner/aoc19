# Day 3

I did this solution without seeing others' thoughts on it and couldn't think of
a way to implement do it using line segments (which is considerably faster)
instead of my grid-based solution.  I'll own this much more inefficient
solution nonetheless - spatial problem solving like this has never been my
forte, and besides, I did it in Vimscript, I sure hope you're not asking
miracles of it.

### Part A solution

```bash
vim "+source 3.vim" "+AOC3a input.txt"
```

The solution will appear below the status line at the bottom of the screen.

### Part B solution

```bash
vim "+source 3.vim" "+AOC3b input.txt"
```

The solution will appear below the status line at the bottom of the screen.
