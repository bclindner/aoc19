# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge,
which at the time of writing is still underway.

I intend to do these in a variety of languages, ranging from domain-specific to
general-purpose, and maybe in esoteric languages if I'm feeling adventurous.

I don't intend to golf these too hard; they're meant to work without being too
verbose, while giving me an opportunity to flex the more niche languages I don't
get to use much.
