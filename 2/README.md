# Day 2

### Part A solution

```bash
make
./2a < input_modded.txt
```

input_modded.txt is used here, where numbers were switched as part of the
directions, as I wrote the 2a program as a general-purpose "Intcode" parser that
returns the first number so that I can check my work for future exercises i.e.
part B.

### Part B solution

```bash
make
./2b < input.txt
```
